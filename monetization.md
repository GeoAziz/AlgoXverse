# AlgoXverse Monetization Plan

AlgoXverse is structured as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform, designed to generate recurring revenue through a tiered subscription model. This model allows for a low-friction entry point to attract a wide user base while offering powerful features for serious traders and institutions at premium price points.

## Subscription Tiers

### 1. Free Trial / Freemium Tier

## Implementation Strategy

The UI for selecting a plan during registration and viewing subscription status in the settings page is already in place. The next step is to integrate a payment gateway like **Stripe** to handle subscriptions and build backend webhooks to automatically assign roles and permissions in Firestore based on the user's payment status.
